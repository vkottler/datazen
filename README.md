# datazen ([1.6.2](https://pypi.org/project/datazen/))

![Python package](https://github.com/vkottler/datazen/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)

*Compile and render schema-validated configuration data.*

Good software is composable and configurable, but
the complexity of managing configuration data scales with its complexity.

This package simplifies data curation and partitioning for uses in rendering
templates, or just rendering final sets of serialized data.

# Usage

```
$ ./venv3.8/bin/dz -h

usage: dz [-h] [--version] [-v] [-C DIR] [-m MANIFEST] [-c] [--sync] [-d]
          [targets [targets ...]]

Compile and render schema-validated configuration data.

positional arguments:
  targets               target(s) to execute

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -v, --verbose         set to increase logging verbosity
  -C DIR, --dir DIR     execute from a specific directory
  -m MANIFEST, --manifest MANIFEST
                        manifest to execute tasks from (default:
                        'manifest.yaml')
  -c, --clean           clean the manifest's cache and exit
  --sync                sync the manifest's cache (write-through) with the
                        state of the file system before execution
