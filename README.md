# datazen

![Python package](https://github.com/vkottler/datazen/workflows/Python%20package/badge.svg)

Compile and render schema-validated configuration data. Good software is composable and configurable, but
the complexity of managing this configuration data scales with the complexity
of the software.

This package simplifies data curation and partitioning for uses in rendering
templates, or even just rendering final sets of serialized data.

# Usage

```
$ ./venv3.8/bin/dz -h

usage: dz [-h] [--version] [-v] [-C DIR] [-m MANIFEST] [-c] [--sync] [-d]
          [targets [targets ...]]

  -m MANIFEST, --manifest MANIFEST
                        manifest to execute tasks from (default:

  -c, --clean           clean the manifest's cache and exit
  --sync                sync the manifest's cache (write-through) with the
